REVIEW METHODS:
Review Question:
To conduct a systematic review of the incidence of postoperative complications in different patients undergoing the MIRPE procedure at different ages.
1.	Are there different rates of complications for patients undergoing repair at different ages?
2.	What are the types of complications affecting patients undergoing repair?
3.	Do the types of complications affecting patients vary by age at repair?

Searches:
To identify potential studies, we will conduct a search through electronic bibliographic databases. We will search the following electronic bibliographic databases: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). We will restrict our search to after the year 1987, when MIRPE was first introduced. Texts with no English translation available will be excluded. 

Specific search terms to be used  are: (("funnel chest"[Mesh] OR ((pectus [TIAB] AND excavatum[TIAB]) or (funnel[TIAB] AND (chest*[TIAB] or breast[TIAB] or breasts[TIAB])) or (sunken[TIAB] AND (sternum[TIAB] or chest*[TIAB])) or trichterbrust[TIAB] or (“cobbler's chest*”[TIAB])) AND ("Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures"[Mesh:NoExp] OR (minimally[TIAB] or surger*[TIAB] or surgical*[TIAB] or procedure*[TIAB] or operation*[TIAB]))) OR (NUSS[TIAB] OR MIRPE[TIAB]).

Condition being Studied:
The condition being studied is pectus excavatum, a common congenital chest wall defect. 

Participants/Populations:
The included population will be patients with pectus excavatum who have undergone repair of the defect with minimally invasive or Nuss repair. All ages at repair will be included in our review. 

Interventions
The study will investigate those undergoing repair via the minimally invasive or Nuss repair technique pioneered by Donald Nuss. The study will exclude those undergoing Nuss repair with another procedure, with significant modifications, or repair of pectus excavatum with another method.

Comparators / Control:
This study will compare the rates and nature of the complications after repair among different ages undergoing repair.

Types of Studies to be Included Initially:
We plan to include original studies reporting on MIRPE that include clear complication and demographic data. We plan to include case series, cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized controlled trials as relevant. We plan to exclude review articles, letters, editorials, commentaries, or technical descriptions that do not report on complication and demographic data. 

Context:
MIRPE has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for pectus excavatum, but initial cohorts were relatively young. The relative rate of complications for older patients and adults undergoing repair is less well-characterized, and the ideal age for repair is uncertain, though likely depends on many individual patient factors.

Primary Outcomes:
We plan to collect data on the complications reported by the authors of the individual studies, including the rate and types of complications for the different ages undergoing repair.

Secondary Outcomes: 
We also plan to collect data on the use of thoracoscopy, sternal elevation, and the number of bars used for repair. 

Data Extraction:
For study selection, two reviewers will independently review article titles and abstracts in Covidence. From those included from title/abstract review, two reviewers will independently review full text articles for inclusion. Any inconsistencies will be resolved through discussion between the reviewers or with the input of a third party. An Excel form will be used for data extraction, to include patient demographics, study types, study time period, complication rates, type of complication (including the complications of pneumothorax, hemothorax, bar migration, recurrence of defect, reoperation, pneumonia, surgical site infection, and other complications as reported in the studies), age groups, and use of thoracoscopy and use of sternal elevation, and number of bars used during repair.  

Risk of Bias Assessment:
Risk of bias will be assessed using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence to assess the quality of the studies to be synthesized.

Strategy for Data Synthesis:
For meta-analysis, the relative complication rates among age groups will be analyzed using odds ratio for the risk of complication relating to the different ages at time of repair. Meta-analysis will be conducted using Cochrane RevMan software. Complication rates among the different age or other categorical variables may be compared using chi-squared analysis. Funnel plots may be used to assess for publication bias.

Analysis of Subgroups:
Further analysis of complication rate in different age groups comparing the number of bars used for the repair may also be performed, in addition to analysis of the impact of thoracoscopy.
